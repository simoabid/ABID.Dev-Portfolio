Creating a portfolio can feel overwhelming — I’ve been there myself.
Deciding what to include, how much detail to share, and making it all feel polished is a challenge every designer faces. So, if you’re feeling stuck, you’re not alone.

As a design lead, I personally review applicants to find the right fit for my team. I like to go through CVs and portfolios myself first, then involve my team for a second round to get different perspectives.

Unfortunately, common issues like broken links, missing details, overly detailed case studies, or hard-to-navigate layouts often make it hard to assess someone’s work. When that happens, I sometimes have to move on to the next portfolio — not because I don’t want to give everyone a chance, but because I don’t have time to dig for missing information.

That’s why a clear, well-organized portfolio is so important. I hope these tips help you create something that reflects your skills and makes you stand out.

1. Keep It Clear, Focused, and Effortless to Navigate
As someone who often juggles multiple tasks, I need a portfolio that quickly showcases your skills and how you think.

Focus on 2-3 of your best projects that highlight the kind of work you want to do.
Craft concise summaries that outline your role, project goals, challenges, process, key learnings, and results.
Use visuals like mockups, prototypes, wireframes, and before-and-after designs to illustrate your impact.
Keep the layout clean and balanced — too many images or dense blocks of text can feel overwhelming.
Structure your content with headings and bullet points to make it easy to scan and visually appealing.
Tip: Consider how a busy manager or recruiter will view your portfolio — they’re often short on time. Make it effortless for them to grasp your potential at a glance and leave a lasting impression.

2. Readability is Key: Make It Easy on the Eyes
Your portfolio reflects your design skills, so it should follow the same principles as a well-designed product.

Use readable fonts that work well on desktop and mobile.
Keep layouts spacious and colours easy on the eyes. Avoid clutter or harsh contrasts.
Strike a balance with visuals and text — images showcase your work, but clear explanations provide context.
Tip: It doesn’t need to be fancy. A simple, well-structured portfolio can be just as impactful as a polished website.

3. Reveal Your Thought Process
I’m not just looking at the final design — I want to understand how you think, solve problems, and make decisions.

Help me understand your process: What was the problem? What constraints did you face? How did you solve it?
Share measurable outcomes if possible (e.g., “Improved conversion rates by 20%”). If you don’t have hard numbers, explain the qualitative impact.
Include before-and-after comparisons for redesign projects. These give context and highlight your impact.
Tip: Showing your process helps me see how you approach challenges and whether your thinking aligns with our team’s needs.

4. Start Strong with a Hook
First impressions matter, and the opening of each project should grab my attention.

Begin with a compelling challenge or unique insight that sets the stage for the project.
Keep it short but engaging — a good hook makes me want to keep reading.
Example: “40% of users couldn’t complete the checkout process. This project was all about solving that.”

5. Show You’re Detail-Oriented
Attention to detail is critical in design, and your portfolio should reflect that.

Ensure your resume includes your portfolio as a clickable link, and always test it to confirm it works. A broken link is frustrating and could hurt your chances.
For easier access, avoid password-protecting your portfolio whenever possible. If required due to an NDA, make sure to include the password.
Use polished visuals — no blurry screenshots or pixelated mockups.
Proofread your portfolio for grammar and structure. Tools like Grammarly, Google Docs, or ChatGPT can help, but keep your tone authentic.
Tip: If your portfolio is hard to navigate or has glaring errors, it might make me question your attention to detail in your work.

6. Highlight Collaboration
Great designers don’t work in silos, so show how you’ve worked with others.

Mention your team: developers, PMs, researchers, or other designers. Be clear about your role and contributions.
Highlight cross-disciplinary work or leadership moments, like facilitating workshops or presenting to stakeholders.
Tip: Collaboration is key to fitting into any team. Show that you’re someone who thrives in a team environment.

7. Tailor Your Portfolio to the Role
You don’t need to start from scratch for every application, but small adjustments can make a big difference.

Highlight projects that are relevant to the company’s industry or products.
Ensure your portfolio is in English if you’re applying for a multinational company.
Use project titles that speak to the role. For example, “Redesigning a Booking Flow for Higher Conversions” is more engaging than “Website Redesign.”
Tip: Personal touches, like referencing a company’s values or product challenges, show that you’ve done your research and care about the role.
