Knowing how to make a portfolio is a must for any designer or creative ready to present their work. An online portfolio is the modern business card, resume and project gallery all in one—the place clients and employers go to see what you can do.


Building a website for your portfolio lets you highlight your skills and unique voice while keeping everything crisp and professional. With the right tools, you can go beyond limits and create an online presence that truly stands out. To get started, here’s a guide on how to start a website that reflects your charm and talent.

How to make a portfolio

A great portfolio puts your best work front and center while showing off your style and making it easy for clients or employers to explore and get in touch. Use clear project descriptions, high-quality images and key pages like About, Resume and Contact. 


Make your site easy to navigate, mobile-friendly and optimized for search engines. Get inspired, pick a design or template that fits you and use AI tools to save time and polish your visuals and text. Keep it fresh by updating often, asking for feedback, sharing it around and tailoring it to the work you want next.



Showcasing your talent should be easy. With Wix’s portfolio builder, you can create a professional, eye-catching portfolio that shows your best work in just a few clicks. Wix’s customizable templates and easy-to-use tools let you present your skills with confidence–leaving a lasting impression on anyone who visits your site.



What is a portfolio? 

A portfolio is a collection of your work, skills, experience and achievements. An online portfolio is a website that brings all of this together, making it easy for employers, clients or collaborators to see what you can do and understand your expertise.


Portfolios are used across all fields, but the most common ones include creative arts (graphic designers, photographers, writers, musicians, etc.), technical fields (software and web developers, engineers) and business. 


When putting together a digital portfolio, focus on the essentials that show what you do best. What to include in a portfolio starts with your top projects, then adds a short bio or About section, your resume or work experience, contact info and any awards, testimonials or extra skills that help highlight your strengths. 


Whether you’re making an art portfolio, a fashion portfolio or a marketing portfolio, it’s your space to express your style, share your story, and make a lasting impression.

how to make a portfolio



01. Gather inspiration for your portfolio

Creating an online portfolio begins with some visual research. Look at other online portfolio websites or digital portfolio examples to generate some initial ideas. 


Next, define your purpose. Decide whether your portfolio is for job applications, freelance clients or school projects, as this will shape both your content and how you present it.


Choose your format. You can go with a physical binder or notebook, but a digital portfolio like a website or PDF is recommended for accessibility and reach.


When looking through these resources, start thinking of the vibe you want your portfolio to convey and what experience you aim to create. Take notes or make a mood board to accompany you throughout your creative process. Consider essential details like the color palette, typography and site structure that you like, and clue yourself in on current web design trends.


Finally, gather your content. Collect all materials in one place using subfolders for work samples, your bio, testimonials and branding elements. Draft your text content, including project descriptions and your “About Me” section, in a document for easy access when building your portfolio.


Gather your current resume, a professional bio, a list of your key skills and any testimonials or letters of recommendation you might have.

02. Choose your online portfolio design

How do you want visitors to move from one page to the next? What do you want them to see first? These are questions you’ll ask yourself at the next step when you’re designing your actual site. 


There are two easy ways to get started at this stage:


Choose a template: Nearly all portfolio website builders will offer pre-built templates that you can choose from. Wix, for example, has dozens of portfolio and CV templates (not to mention 900+ total website templates) spanning all types of industries. Learn more about website builders in this comparison guide: Wix vs Squarespace.


Design with AI: Use an AI website builder like Wix that can create a bespoke site for you in minutes. With Wix, simply chat with AI about the type of portfolio you want to achieve—then watch as AI designs a site to match your goals and desired aesthetic.


Pro tip: Decide on the hierarchy of your pages and the user journey. This will help visitors explore your work without feeling lost. Include clear menus and consider a table of contents for large portfolios.

03. Showcase only your best projects and work

When learning how to make a portfolio, remember that your actual work is the core of your online portfolio, so make sure to showcase it in the best way possible. It should stand out and be easily reachable through the homepage and/or website menu. You can highlight this work by creating a dedicated “projects” page on your website.


Did you know? Wix’s AI portfolio creator saves you hours of repetitive work by allowing you to upload media and instantly arrange them into projects, complete with suggested titles and descriptions. 



Share your best work


Expose clients to your creativity and skill by sharing only your best work. Focus on quality over quantity. Choose 8 to 12 of your strongest, most recent and most relevant pieces that demonstrate the breadth of your skills. This way, you’ll bring their attention to your strengths and maintain a consistent level of quality throughout your portfolio. 


Include examples that highlight different aspects of your expertise, such as technical skills, creative problem-solving and collaboration. Whenever possible, include quantitative data (e.g., "Increased sales by 14%") or testimonials to validate your success.


Make sure to include close-up shots of intricate details in your work, too. This allows viewers to appreciate the craftsmanship and finer elements of your designs.


Arrange your items in an order that makes sense, such as by project type, chronology (most recent first) or theme.


For each project, include a brief description or case study that outlines the brief, your thought process, your specific role and the project's outcome. This tells a story about your work ethic.



Add context and keep it fresh


For each project, include the goal, your thinking process, your specific role and the final outcome. Sharing process work like sketches or drafts can build credibility and show your problem-solving approach.


Consider adding a "Passion Project" section to your portfolio. This is a space to showcase work you’ve done purely out of interest or curiosity, unrelated to client demands. It highlights your creativity, initiative and personal style, offering a refreshing glimpse into your unique perspective.


Make sure to update your website every once in a while so that you’re always sharing your most recent creations. Including a variety of pieces can help people get a sense of your range.


It’s helpful to add a narrative for each project so that visitors can get a sense of how you come up with creative solutions and/or work with your clients. An oft-overlooked portfolio design tip: make sure to give a concise description of the project and mention your role, as well as any collaborators you worked with.


Expert tip from Hani Safe, product manager at Wix:

"An outstanding portfolio is all about storytelling. It’s not just a showcase of work, but a narrative that weaves together a professional’s skills, creativity and personality. Features like dynamic presets, AI setup and beautiful templates let creators bring their stories to life, ensuring that every portfolio not only stands out for its aesthetic appeal, but also tells a compelling story about the creator behind it." 


04. Use high-quality visuals

It’s not just photography portfolios that need high-quality images; all portfolios need them, whether you’re making a fashion portfolio or a marketing portfolio. 


To ensure that your work looks as impressive online as it does in real life, invest time and effort into photographing your work, your process and your products. In cases where professional photography or a photo shoot is not feasible, follow product photography best practices or use free photo-editing tools to enhance your images. 


Make sure all your images are high-resolution and clearly labeled.


Show your work in real-world settings


Another way to enhance the presentation of your projects is by using mockups. Mockups allow you to display your designs in real-world settings, such as showing logo designs on stationery or app interfaces on devices. This not only elevates the look of your work but also helps potential clients or employers visualize how your projects come to life.

Make sure to maintain a consistent visual identity using chosen colors, fonts and logos throughout your portfolio.


When showcasing your images, the Wix Pro Gallery can set you up with customizable layouts and effects. You can also use AI tools available in Wix—like an object eraser, background remover and more—to professionalize your images.



05. Include the right portfolio content and features

Once you have a good base from which you can set off and a collection of projects ready to display, it’s time to identify which additional content you want to include in your online portfolio and how to present it strategically. 


This includes text, images and other media. Whether you need some model portfolio examples or you're creating an industrial design portfolio, graphic design portfolio, a stunning photography portfolio or any other type of website. Here are the most crucial pages and sections to include, plus some professional design features to consider:



Homepage

 

The virtual home of your portfolio should grab your visitors’ attention with an eye-catching design. On top of the visual aspect, your homepage is a chance to stir the curiosity of potential clients and employers with a powerful introductory sentence. Keep this sentence short and sweet, clearly expressing who you are and what you do. There’s no need to go into your biographical details here (that’s what your ‘About’ page is for), but your name and main area of expertise are an absolute must.


Since your homepage acts as a starting point for visitors, be sure to also include a menu of items that’s easy to find and directs users to the right places on your site. 



About page

 

The About page is where you present your background and short bio, provide essential information about your activities and summarize your unique identity and values. Include any distinctive elements, such as your achievements and skills. It can also be a good idea to clarify your current employment status and include your CV. We recommend adding a downloadable PDF so those interested in hiring you can add it to their system. 


You can show off your personality with puns, smart microcopy, illustrations or anything else that feels true to you. Take a cue from DA Creative which emphasizes its confident and assertive bio with futuristic graphics and bold bits of microcopy.

Contact information

 

Make sure people who’ve visited your site can easily contact you to inquire more about your services or employment status. Add a contact form, your email address, phone number and links to your social networks.


These elements can be featured in various areas of your site: your main menu, on a dedicated contact page or as a pinned element on the side of the screen. It’s also a good idea to repeat your contact details in your website footer, offering visitors a final invitation to get in touch.

 


Clients and testimonials

 

Highlight your professionalism with a list of respected clientele who have chosen to work with you in the past. If any of your projects have been featured elsewhere or have received press coverage, mention that too (especially for a portfolio dedicated to high-ticket industries, like architecture portfolios).


You might additionally want to drop in a testimonial or two by satisfied clients. As long as the feedback feels genuine and not over-the-top, testimonials often add credibility to your online portfolio. Adding references can also achieve this.


Won any awards? Include these too. The type of award, the issuing body and the date you received it. Provide any needed context on the competition too. 



Incorporate professional features

 

To craft a professional look and an engaging experience, see how you can incorporate design features that catch your visitors’ eye by taking your online portfolio design up a notch. From hover effects and parallax scrolling to animation and lightboxes, these finishing touches can help bring your website to life. They can also serve as functional tools, drawing your visitors’ attention to a specific place or generating interaction.


Tata Rekso demonstrates the sizable impact these elements can have on the user experience. When you hover over one of her featured works, the text changes color and a sneak peek of the work pops up beside it. 


With Wix, hover effects like these are easy to add. If the effect you're looking for isn't available, you can use Wix Studio to make your site more dynamic and tailor it to your specific needs. This web development platform lets you insert code elements into your website with various custom interactions, helping you bring your most intricate visions to life on your portfolio.

Contents page


If your portfolio contains a lot of examples of your work and projects, you might want to consider including a contents section to organize them all. This is also a good idea if you plan to create one portfolio to reflect all your different types of projects and skills. You can use the contents page to organize your content by projects, or expertise — and help whoever you share it with navigate to the most relevant work for them. 



Resume


Creating an online portfolio to showcase your work means it acts as a resume also. Go one step further and include a page that summarizes your work experience so far — both in-house, freelance or contractual. Include where you worked, your key responsibilities and projects and the dates. Start with the most recent first. Make sure to provide a list of your hard skills and expertise. You might include the design tools you know how to work with, or whatever is relevant for your field. 



Personal statement


Consider starting your resume page with a personal statement to set the tone and provide context for your entire collection of work. This allows you to share your background, highlight unique skills and articulate your professional goals. A well-crafted personal statement turns your portfolio into a compelling narrative that distinguishes you in a competitive market. 



Showcase the design process


Showing the design process in a portfolio offers a window into your creative journey and problem-solving abilities. By including sketches, drafts and various development stages, designers can vividly illustrate their approach to tackling challenges and refining ideas. This level of transparency not only highlights your creativity and adaptability but also builds trust with potential clients and employers.

06. Improve your portfolio's UX

Now that you have your content, it’s time to make all the pieces come together. There are a number of factors to take into account for creating a strong UX, or user experience, on your website.



Plan your portfolio pages and content


Start by listing all the web pages you’ve decided to create. Then, identify which elements will need to be included on each page (although if you used an AI website builder, your site may already be hooked up with all the core elements and content that you need).


For example, a project page might include a featured image, header and description, plus a few extra images or media features. Listing the items on each page will help you decide on their hierarchy before fleshing out the content. 



Guide users with navigation and structure


Don’t forget to add a table of contents, especially if your portfolio spans multiple pages or showcases a wide variety of work. A table of contents makes it easier for users to find specific sections or projects quickly, improving their overall experience. It acts as a guide for your site, helping visitors explore your work without feeling lost.


Once you know which pages will make up your online portfolio, you’ll be able to decide on the navigation. How do you want your visitors to transition from one page to another? Will you include a hamburger menu that opens up into a fullscreen list, or a fixed menu at the top of each page? How will you indicate what page people are on?



Learn from portfolio examples


UX designer Diana Renko's portfolio illustrates that great UX design can be both functional and inventive. Her redesigned hamburger menu stands out for its unique spin while remaining easily recognizable. This creative approach showcases Renko's ability to blend familiar usability with personal style, proving that good UX design need not be dull.

07. Work on your site's SEO

What good is an online portfolio if no one gets to see it? In order for your clients to find you and book your services easily, work towards optimizing your website to bring it higher up on Google search results.


Search engine optimization (SEO) is an ongoing task, concerning various elements of your site. Here are some pointers will help you get started:

 

Create unique, fresh and valuable written content: Write blog posts or portfolio descriptions that share ideas other creatives will enjoy. This shows both visitors and search engines that your site is active and relevant. (See writing portfolio examples for inspiration). 


Use relevant keywords: Research commonly searched phrases in your field, like “independent web designer” or “Toronto architect”, and integrate them into page titles, descriptions, headings and content.


Write SEO-friendly alt text for your images: Provide brief, descriptive text for all images (for example, “postcards and business cards for a branding project”). Alt text improves accessibility and helps search engines understand your visuals.


Optimize metadata: Ensure each page has a clear title and description to improve search visibility.


Leverage local SEO: If you have a physical location, claim your business on Google My Business, add your location to pages and register on relevant directories to attract local clients.

 

Pro tip: If you have a Wix website, try Wix SEO. It’s a free, step-by-step plan designed to help improve your site’s SEO with a tailored checklist and helpful tips. You can additionally use Wix’s AI meta tag creator to write title tags and descriptions at scale. 



08. Make it mobile-friendly

It’s easy to forget about the huge amount of users who are likely to be viewing your site from a smartphone. In fact, mobile devices account for Nearly 60% of web page views worldwide. That’s why the best website designs should look just as good on mobile as they do on desktop.



Design your portfolio for small screens


One of the major challenges designers face when it comes to creating a portfolio online is ensuring that it will be mobile-compatible. Your mobile website is more than just web design made smaller, so there are a few rules to keep in mind when designing for mobile.


For the small screen, you’ll want to declutter the mobile version of your site, keeping only the most crucial elements visible. Furthermore, pay attention to the fonts and colors you use and make sure they’re legible. Reduce the amount of typing required and consider adding a search bar to ease navigation.


Take a look at journalist Lauryn Higgins' portfolio to see an example of mobile design done right. Her minimalist design easily translates to mobile—a good argument to choose a minimalist design style if it suits your brand.



Tools to simplify portfolio mobile design


If you’re creating your portfolio with Wix, your site will automatically generate a mobile-friendly version, with an adaptive gallery for your images. That cuts down a significant portion of the work, but it's important to check the mobile editor every time you update your site design to check that the generated site correctly captures your vision.

09. Ask for honest feedback 

We all know the feeling of getting lost in a project until we lose sight of what it really looks like. That’s why it’s always best to run your website by a second set of eyes for some insight and fresh ideas. Ask your trusted friends what they have to say about your portfolio’s content and visuals. Did they think your portfolio was missing information? What did they like or dislike about your site’s appearance? Was it easy to navigate? Even if it means making adjustments, critical feedback from your peers can help you fine-tune the details of your site.


To get the most helpful feedback, be specific about what you’re looking for. For example, ask reviewers to focus on areas like navigation, project descriptions or the overall visual hierarchy. Provide context for your decisions, such as why you chose a particular layout or color scheme, so they can offer more targeted suggestions. Additionally, consider asking people from different backgrounds—designers, potential clients or even those unfamiliar with your field—to ensure your portfolio resonates with a broad audience. This diverse input can help you identify blind spots and refine your portfolio for maximum impact.



10. Publish and promote 

Once you’ve published your online portfolio, don’t forget to share it on all of your social channels, from Pinterest to Dribbble and more. This straightforward social media marketing strategy will help you reach more potential customers, improve your SEO ranking and hear honest feedback.


Another Instagram tip for designers is to add social buttons to your site, helping visitors reach your social media profiles easily. 


After you’ve gotten the word out, remember that your portfolio should grow with you. There’s always another tweak around the corner to make it a little better. Keep updating your site with new content and projects, implementing different features, improving the user experience and staying up-to-date with current design trends.
