High-level plan — make your portfolio “pro”

Great brief. Below is a focussed, practical blueprint you can hand to AI agents (and humans) to take your HTML/CSS/JS portfolio from simple → premium. I cover technology choices, concrete libraries & assets, architecture & file structure, visual / interaction recipes (how to reproduce Lando-style effects), performance & accessibility, deployment/observability, and ready-to-use AI agent tasks + prompt templates so agents can do the work end-to-end.

1) Recommended stack (primary — production grade)

Use this stack for maximum control, performance and ability to create complex animations and 3D:

Framework: Next.js (app router) + React + TypeScript

Why: SSR/SSG, image optimization, route-based code splitting, great DX, easy deployment to Vercel/Netlify.

Styling: Tailwind CSS + CSS variables for theme tokens (light/dark). Use a design-token file for colors/spacing/typography.

Animations: GSAP (core) + ScrollTrigger for scroll-driven animations. Use Lenis for smooth, inertial scrolling.

3D / WebGL: three.js integrated via react-three-fiber (R3F) + drei utilities + GLTF models (DRACO compressed). Use postprocessing for bloom, vignette.

Vector animations: Rive or Lottie for interactive vector micro-animations. Use Rive when you want real-time interactive state machines (like helmet morphs, toggles).

State + UI: React state, small UI-only components; avoid heavy UI frameworks. Use shadcn or headless primitives only if you want accessible components fast.

Image CDN & optimization: Cloudinary or imgix or Cloudflare Images (or Next/Image with remote loader).

Hosting/CDN: Vercel (or Netlify). Add Cloudflare in front for global edge caching and WAF if needed.

Analytics / Tagging: GA4 + Google Tag Manager (GTM).

Accessibility / Testing: axe / lighthouse, Playwright for visual/regression tests.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions; PR → automatic preview deployment, Lighthouse CI.

Alternative simpler stack: If you want less code overhead, Webflow + custom code embeds + Cloudflare + GSAP can produce similar visuals faster. But Webflow limits custom 3D and fine control.

2) Key libraries & why (short list you should install)

react, next, typescript — core.

tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer — styling.

gsap + gsap/ScrollTrigger — robust timeline & scroll-driven animations.

@studio-freight/lenis — smooth scroll with inertia (pair with GSAP).

@react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei, three — 3D scenes and glTF model viewer.

r3f-postprocessing or postprocessing — effects (bloom, vignette).

rive-js or lottie-web — vector interactive animations.

swr or react-query — data fetching (if using headless CMS).

sanity or contentful or DatoCMS — optional headless CMS for collections (projects, helmets).

clsx — class merging for Tailwind.

sharp (dev pipeline) — image transforms for build.

eslint, prettier, husky — code quality.

3) Design system & assets

Typography: choose a bold display serif for headings (variable display font) + a neutral sans (variable) for body. Use variable fonts to reduce weight and enable dynamic styles (e.g., big condensed headings). Example: "Space Grotesk / Playfair Display" or premium alternatives.

Color palette: high-contrast dark/olive/acid lime + neutral backgrounds. Create CSS variables --primary, --accent, --bg, etc.

Iconography: use SVG icons (inline) for crispness and animation.

Image format: supply .avif / .webp fallbacks and multiple sizes. Deliver 1x / 2x / 3x.

3D assets: glTF for helmets, optimized with DRACO and KTX2 (basis) compressed textures.

4) Component & folder structure (Next.js + TypeScript)
/src
  /app
    /[route]               # pages
  /components
    Hero/
      Hero.tsx
      Hero.module.css     # or tailwind classes
    Nav/
    ThemeToggle/
    ProjectsGrid/
    ProjectCard/
    HelmetGallery/
      HelmetViewer.tsx    # R3F scene + controls
    Footer/
  /lib
    gsap.ts
    lenis.ts
    three-utils.ts
  /styles
    tokens.css
    globals.css
  /public
    /models
    /images
  /content
    projects/*.mdx (or use headless CMS)

5) Visual & interaction recipes (how to reproduce Lando style)
Hero: layered, dynamic face/helmet split

Technique: full-bleed hero with two overlapping layers — a top photoreal face and a masked lower rotating helmet. Use CSS clip-path and a small JS parallax driven by scroll.

Implementation: high-res hero image, overlay SVG mask, GSAP timeline that animates mask path + photo scale + opacity on scroll.

Polish: subtle tilt via transform: rotateY() on mouse move, with requestAnimationFrame smoothing.

Smooth inertial scroll + scroll synced animations

Lenis provides smooth scrolling. Pair with GSAP’s ScrollTrigger using the scrollerProxy pattern so ScrollTrigger responds to Lenis.

Use case: big typographic reveal (oversized words) that animate individually — split headings into words/letters and animate with GSAP stagger.

3D helmet viewer

Technique: load GLTF (helmet), add environment lighting, bloom, and use OrbitControls with limited rotation and auto-rotation. Add highlight on hover and “inspect” modal.

Performance: lazy-load the 3D viewer only on interaction (click “view helmet”), low-poly initial LOD with a higher-detail model on demand. Use draco and KTX2 basis compression.

UX: show loading skeleton + progressive enhancement (2D fallback images).

Gallery & hover effects

Masonry grid: CSS grid with grid-auto-flow:dense; or Masonry layout JS.

Hover: tilt + parallax + subtle vignette + reveal caption. Use GSAP for hover in/out (scale, translate, clip).

Modal: full-screen modal with swipe navigation on mobile.

Typographic scale & layout

Use large display numeric counters (big 41 style). Implement as DOM text animated by GSAP (count up) and made responsive with clamp: font-size: clamp(48px, 10vw, 300px).

SVG & stroke animations

Animate SVG strokes using GSAP drawSVG plugin (paid) or manual stroke-dasharray technique with GSAP tweens.

Microinteractions

Button hovers: expand ring outline, soft shadow; use CSS variables for transitions.

Theme toggle: animated icon using Rive for state transitions.

6) Performance & SEO best practices

Critical CSS: inline above-the-fold minimal styles; rest with Tailwind compiled CSS.

Image strategy: use responsive srcset, loading="lazy", and CDN delivery in AVIF/WebP.

Bundle splitting: dynamic import heavy libs (three, gsap) only when needed.

Lighthouse goals: Aim LCP < 1.5s (optimize hero image), TBT < 150ms (defer heavy JS).

Metadata: JSON-LD schema for Person, Organization, breadcrumbs; full Open Graph tags, Twitter Card.

Accessibility: keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, high contrast, alt texts. Use axe to test.
